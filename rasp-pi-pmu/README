This directory contains two modules for reading the performance
counters on a Raspberry-pi.

The perf_event interface does not support the Rasp-pi because the
hardware is missing a PMU interrupt.  So while you can start,
stop, and read the counters, there is no way to be informed
of an overflow (and thus no way to do traditional sampling
or emulated 64-bit counters).  In theory it is possible to modify
the ARM perf_event driver to simulate things with a periodic timer,
but no one has gotten around to it yet.

In the meantime you can use these modules.

The rasp-pi-pmu-test.ko module is a simple test that starts the 
counters, runs a million instructions, and verifies that the results
we get are sane.

The rasp-pi-pmu.ko module can be used as a very crude performance monitor
interface.  To use, 
  insmod ./rasp-pi-pmu.ko
  do your workload
  rmmod rasp-pi-pmu
and in the system log (visible to dmesg) you will see your event counts.
By default it measures Cycles, Instructions, and Branches.  To measure more you
will need to edit the source and recompile.

The values returned are system-wide values.  They will also include
kernel+user values, but that's OK as the ARM PMU can't distinguish
those anyways.

To compile, just run "make".  This depends on the kernel headers for
the kernel you are running being installed.
